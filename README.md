## 	![Shopping Cartulator Logo](assets/shopping_cart_favicon.png) Shopping Cartulator
A handy little shopping list app built with React Native and Expo.

Created with the frugal shopper in mind (like myself), this app allows users to add items to a list, specifying the item's name, cost, and quantity. As the user checks the items, i.e. adds them to the cart, the total amount is dynamically calculated and displayed.
This helps give an estimate of your cart's total value *before* arriving at the cashier and getting a nasty surprise...
